# ODE-Class-Project-Error-Analysis-of-Different-Numerical-Schemes-Solving-ODE-Problems

In this project, we analyzed the error between the real solution of a multi-dimensional ODE problem and the solution generated by different numerical schemes. Numerical schemes that we taken into consider first order schemes and figher oder schemes, in particular Newton's method, Euler's method, and Runge-Kutta method at level four.  
We first addressed the problem from theoretical aspect, and then used codes to realize these methods at various step size. Finally we visualized the error to give a more direct view of the influence of step size on different methods.
